# script-flatten-and-compress
## flattens, strips, and compresses bash scripts

flattens
: follows all ./source includes and writes them into a single script

strips
: remove all comment and blank lines

compresses
: compresses with gzip and wraps it so it can still be ran


why flatten a script  
sometimes going through the hassle of finding and installing libraries just to  
try your script on a new system is painful. Flattening copies all the  
libraries into your script, so it just works.

why strip a script  
just want it a bit smaller. It hard to think when this would be useful with  
the current data transfer speeds and storage sizes, but it may come in handy  
for certain applications.

why compress a script  
again this boils down to size. Another usage of compressing stuff into your
script is packaging.  
i.e. download a single script that contains and can deploy all the files of a
package.
